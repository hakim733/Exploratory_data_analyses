# Advanced Data Analysis Techniques on EU Economic Indicators

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of various datasets involving EU economic indicators, lung cancer genomics, and geometrically structured synthetic data. The primary focus is on applying advanced data analysis techniques to uncover underlying patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of different clustering and dimension reduction methods.

## Project Overview

This project involves multiple datasets and aims to:
- Analyze EU unemployment and inflation data using k-means clustering.
- Explore lung cancer genomic data through hierarchical clustering and the minimum spanning tree approach.
- Generate and analyze synthetic datasets for model-based clustering.
- Employ non-linear dimension reduction techniques on complex geometrical shapes.

## Datasets

The analyses involve several distinct datasets:
- **EU Economic Indicators**: Includes data on unemployment and inflation across European Union countries from 2015 to 2024.
- **Lung Cancer Data**: Focuses on gene expression profiles in different types of lung cancer.
- **Synthetic Geometrical Data**: Consists of artificially generated datasets with predefined geometric properties to test clustering algorithms.

## Analysis Techniques

1. **K-Means Clustering**: Used to identify patterns in EU economic data.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering and MST**: Applied to lung cancer data for gene clustering.
3. **Model-Based Clustering (MBC)**: Utilized on synthetic datasets to evaluate the clustering of objects with geometric properties.
4. **Dimension Reduction Techniques**: Including PCA, LLE, and HLLE, applied to complex datasets to simplify data visualization and analysis.
